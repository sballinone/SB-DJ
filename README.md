**SETLIST** Create your setlist and enjoy full playlist integration

**WISHLIST** Are you tired of guests interupting you with their wishes? As your Co-DJ, SB DJ allowes your guests sending their wishes without interupting you.

**PLAYLIST** Create your playlist and CSV-export it at the end of the night.

**QR CODE FLYER** Allow your guests to access the public part of SB DJ quickly by printing flyers with a QR Code.

**BUILT IN SECURITY** Secure your actor's part of the software from the public part. Disallow "double-votes" on wishes. High code quality.
